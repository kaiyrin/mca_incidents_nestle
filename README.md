## Incident management dashboard in Workstation service: A long-term solution for enhanced classification and actionable insights

* Developed a Workstations Services Incidents dashboard to analyse recurring incident patterns and propose comprehensive ITSM solutions, shifting focus from individual tickets to a full view. The focus was on resolving issues related to applications under the "AA" category, which exhibit diverse incident types.


* Developed a comprehensive understanding of incidents within the AA category and cluster them based on more meaningful categories to enhance incident management efficiency that enabled us to propose targeted actions. Using text mining techniques to clean and analyse incident descriptions, employed word bubble techniques to identify crucial aspects of end-users' problems, and multiple correspondence analysis for deep sentiment analysis.

* So that, it has been enhanced compliance and incident management in Workstation Services by proposing actions to conduct long-term reviews of resolved tickets and identify common features in new tickets. Implemented a sustainable clustering solution to reduce a misclassification of incidentsâ€™ categories created by end users, leading to reducing the accumulation of long-term incidents across different categories. From now on, there is no need to add complicated classification surveys for end-users for precise understanding of application belonging to those incidents, which is crucial for identifying vendors working on this issue. This solution enables efficient grouping of related incidents and identification of potential incident series caused by common factors during ticket opening, leading to improved incident classification and resolution.
